# Open Self-driving vehicles datasets
Part of the [Open Machine Learning Datasets project](https://github.com/meetaime/open-machine-learning-datasets/blob/master/README.md). Do you have a dataset? Feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/meetaime/open-machine-learning-datasets/blob/master/README.md)!

## Datasets
| Name and link | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [Bosch Small Traffic Lights Dataset](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/node/6132) | 13427 camera images at a resolution of 1280x720 pixels and contains about 24000 annotated traffic lights.
